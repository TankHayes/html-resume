<h1>About Me, Demetrius Hayes</h1>
<h2>Way Back</h2>
<p>My mother brought us to Fort Wayne Indiana when I was 3 years old. No doubt for a better opportunity</p>
<p>I have a bit more motivation than the majority of people I have worked with. Due to the fact we grew up with not much but each other</p>
<h2>I love sprinting, martials arts, art, and cars</h2>
<p>Activities were free when we were growing up, and we stayed out as long as we could</p>
<p>Art was very fulfilling and I could spend hours just drawing til my heart was content</p>
<h2>Wasn't a great student until after graduating</h2>
<p>Loved being a laborer until I realized I couldn't stand being a laborer, FOREVER</p>
<p>Then I reaalized there were a world of opportunities for knowing things.</p>
<hr>
<h2>And this lead me to web Development after pursuing other studies</h2>
<p>Been on the other side of trying to become a millionaire. A lot of it is scams and high pressure sales</p>
<p>I am here to make a great living and let my soul have peace knowing I'm not stealing from others</p>
<p>I enjoy my work and love the life it will bring to my family and I</p>
