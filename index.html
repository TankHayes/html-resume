<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I attended Northrop High School from 1989 to 1993. The school is located in Fort Wayne Indiana. Can't remember what my GPA was there. But, I didn't gget serious about education  and grades until my Junior year. I think towards the middle of the school year a counselor talked to me and showed me that if I picked up my GPA I could go to Indiana University in Bloomington Indiana. Which brings me to Indiana University. That was 1993 to 1994. I didn't do well there. I enjoyed Fine Arts until I realized that I was going to have someone tell me to curb my passion and only do what they wanted. Killed my heart. I still enjoyed Art, but a part of me died there and the only time I really try to do anything artsy is when I'm with young kids. Feels like the only time I'm inspired that way. And, it's fun then. After that I really didn't feel serious about education again until 2001. That is the year I began at Ivy Tech Community College. It's in Fort Wayne Indiana. I attended that school from 2001-2004 and 2005-2006. I began wanting to get into the electrician field. My Grandmother's husband was an electrician and he earned a decent living. But... they didn't have that field for another 4 or 5 years. I tested and they found me to be excelling in math. It was recommended that I begin a career in electronics teechnology. Sounded interesting to me so I enrolled in the curiculum. Excellent choice. I would have meandered around the rest of my life getting by if it wasn't for my Professor named Rahiim Negabahn. Can't tell you how grateful I am that he came into my life! I got about halfway into my first semester and I'm only bringing in a B, B+ average in his class. He really cared about me. He took me in the hall and explained that I was wasting my talent and I was performing way below what he expected for me. He expected that I should be pulling in an A+. And not just in that class, in all of my classes. Thought about it and I basically did it from then on. I think I had a B in English and pretty much A+ and a few A's. I think I graduated with a  3.7? But, I'm pretty sure I'm underestimating. I graduated with my associates in 2004. I returned in 2005 to try my hand at culinary arts because I was and still am mesmerized by Emeril Lagasse in a kitchen making any and everything and yelling "BAM!" as he finished a dish with essence or parsley or powdered sugar. The man is amazing. Well, I loved the program. But, working every holiday and the long hours and I didn't love it enough to work that hard for someone else. Maybe for myself when I retire. But, I did well in there. Not 3.9 well, but well. It was challenging. Oh, the reason I wasn't in electronice was that I lacked experience even though I was very sharp and able to do way better than someone who had 4 years of college at that time. But, I couldn't get hired. Plus' I had a felony for something seriously stupid. Talking back to a police officer can get you a felony. Seriously. Next I went to ITT Tech technical Institute here in Fort Wayne Indiana. That was from 2006-2008. I studied Robotics Engineering Technology. Another awesome Professor. Taught me how to search the internet until I found exactly whatI  wanted. He was another example of what massive intelligence looks like. Myron Bickly. I graduated there with a 3.7. That was a very hard major for me. I'm not great at Calculus. I learned it when I was there. But, my brain didn't hold onto it. That is another beast. From that I will say that, pretty much everything in the world is a lot easier than that to me. But, I did get my degree. And I had the hardest time getting a job. No experience, of course. I had soo much knowledge at that time. It was ridiculous. But, I got a job doing something other than robotics, Until I got sick.     </p>
<h2>Work History</h2>
<p>I wasn't working in 2010 to 2016 because I was sick from Schizoprenia. I am a person who doesn't like taking  medicine if I don't have to. Well, GUESS WHAT? When you have Schizoprenia, you HAVE to take medicine. That was my lesson. But, I did begin working aain and worked at Subway Restaurants for a total of 2 years. In Downtown Fort Wayne and also in the Western end of town under the same boss. Next was Scottys Brewhouse. It's a restaurant, but more like a sports bar. I began in the Dishroom. And, when things slowed down the manager found out that I was a great cleaner. He made a position for me to clean up the outside and inside restaurant in the mornings before I began dishes. Earned employee of the month about two times. Only because they stopped it for about a year while I was there. After that I moved to a new restaurant. Rosatis Pizzeria. 2018. Place was badly run. Closed down in less than a year. I washed dishes and made pizzas. Yes, at the sane time. And I came in before opening to make fresh pizza dough and prepare the toppings. Things slowed down there real fast and they only wanted nightly employees. I took a voluntary layoff. While I was working there a manager noticed  how much I was showing up to work early. The manager asked me to work for him at Burger King because I came in there weekly and knew I'd be there. That was 2018. I worked there for two years. Until the guy I worked with at Rosatis asked me to join 5 Guys in 2020. I did a little of everything there. Worked for another two years there. Until I was basically sick of working at restaurants. Worked at Biaggis Italian Restaurant. Made desserts and salads. Excellent salads and Desserts. Couldn't afford to work there so I left after only 3 or 4 months. 2022 Began at Chipotle doing dishes. Moved to dishes and Prep. Tried to do management, but there were too many issues. December 2023 Began one of the best jobs ever! As an upholstry apprentice. As the Owner said, Larry, we were engineers. Most stressful and rewarding job I've ever had. The recovery room. I worked there until July 2024. Loved the job, but I'm worried that I won't have any money left when I retire. And, I'm not sure I could handle that job for another even 5 years because it is physical  at  times. And I'm Old. I quit that job to begin my studies in Full Stack Web Development. </p>
